MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents (BSON) rather than traditional rows and tables. It is designed for scalability, high availability, and performance.
Here’s a one-line summary of MongoDB’s key features:

Document-Oriented Storage: Stores data as flexible, JSON-like documents (BSON).
Schema Flexibility: Allows dynamic, schema-less data models.
Scalability: Supports horizontal scaling through sharding.
Replication and High Availability: Ensures data redundancy and failover using replica sets.
Aggregation Framework: Provides powerful tools for data processing and analysis.
ACID Transactions: Supports multi-document transactions for consistency.
Indexing: Speeds up queries with various index types.
Geospatial Support: Enables storage and querying of location-based data.
Flexible Data Model: Allows complex, nested data structures.
Rich Query Language: Supports advanced queries with powerful operators.
Cloud & On-Premise Deployment: Can be deployed on both cloud (via Atlas) and on local servers.


 MongoDB, CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are essential for interacting with the database. Here's a quick guide to each operation:

1. Create (Insert Data)
insertOne(): Adds a single document to a collection.
insertMany(): Adds multiple documents to a collection.
2. Read (Query Data)
find(): Retrieves documents from a collection based on a filter. It returns a cursor by default.
findOne(): Retrieves a single document based on a filter.
3. Update (Modify Data)
updateOne(): Updates a single document that matches the filter.
updateMany(): Updates multiple documents that match the filter.
replaceOne(): Replaces a document entirely based on a filter.
Example:
4. Delete (Remove Data)
deleteOne(): Deletes a single document based on a filter.
deleteMany(): Deletes multiple documents based on a filter.
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used for storing and
exchanging data, commonly between a server and a web application. It is easy to read and write,
using key-value pairs and arrays.
